<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Announces annotation of models as a new feature of CPLEX V12.7.0.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX V12.7.0 offers an application programming interface (API) for the purpose of annotating the
objects of a model. An annotation specifies a key and value pair, where keys  are strings, and values 
can be either <samp class="ph codeph">long</samp>  or <samp class="ph codeph">double</samp>. You can associate an annotation 
with each element (such as the objective, variables, constraints, rows,
columns, and so forth) of your model. CPLEX can take advantage of these annotations as it solves
your model. For example, these annotations make it possible for you to specify to CPLEX the blocks
of a partition of the variables to apply Benders algorithm. Conventionally, the key 
<samp class="ph codeph">cpxBendersPartition</samp> with the value 0 (zero) 
designates elements in the master, while other values designate subproblems of the partition.
(See the announcement <a class="xref" href="newBenders.html" title="Announces Benders algorithm as a new feature of CPLEX V12.7.0.">Benders algorithm in CPLEX V12.7.0</a> 
in these release notes for more about Benders algorithm as supported in
CPLEX V12.7.0. Also see the new topic 
<a class="xref" href="../../../UsrMan/topics/discr_optim/benders/annotations.html" title="Annotation of a model specifies to CPLEX how to decompose your model.">Annotating a model for CPLEX</a> 
in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX User's Manual</em>.)</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX V12.7.0 also offers a new <strong class="ph b">file format</strong>, <samp class="ph codeph">ANN</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">.ann</samp>,
to support annotations of modeling objects. CPLEX can read annotations from such a formatted file
and apply those annotations to your model. CPLEX can also collect annotations from a model and write
those annotations to such a formatted file. </p>
