<body id="introModelingAssistance"><div role="main">
<h1 class="title topictitle1">Modeling assistance in CPLEX</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CPLEX can assist you as you develop your model.</p>
<p class="p">CPLEX offers assistance to help you to identify and to eliminate troublesome elements from
your model. Turn on modeling assistance by setting the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/DataCheck.html" title="Turns on or off data consistency checking and modeling assistance.">data consistency checking and modeling assistance</a> parameter to the value CPX_DATACHECK_ASSIST (2).
After this data-checking parameter is turned on at this level, CPLEX modeling assistance prints
warnings (in the warning log or on the warning channel, depending on your settings for messages).
The warnings are about potential problems in your model. For example, modeling assistance will
report bounds, coefficients, and righthand side (RHS) values that are inappropriately large or
small. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Kappa and modeling assistance</h2> 
 
<p class="p">Modeling assistance can report kappa (also known as the condition number,  
a statistical evaluation of bases or models) for both linear programs (LP) and 
mixed integer programs (MIP). This information can help you identify ill conditioning 
in your model. For more about kappa and how to interpret it, see the topics 
<a class="xref" href="../../cont_optim/simplex/20_ill_conditioning.html" title="Introduces CPLEX behavior with respect to ill conditioning in LP models.">Ill conditioning</a> 
and 
<a class="xref" href="../../discr_optim/mip/troubleshoot/60_ill_conditioned_MIP_kappa.html" title="Recommends techniques to detect ill conditioning in your MIP model.">MIP kappa: detecting and coping with ill-conditioned MIP models</a> 
in the <em class="ph i">CPLEX User's Manual</em>.</p>
 </div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Symbols of modeling assistance</h2> 

<p class="p">Modeling assistance uses symbols that are prefixed by the name CPXMI_ 
(for Modeling Information) 
to report possibly troublesome elements of your model. For more detail 
about these symbols that identify information gathered about your model, see 
<a class="xref" href="../../../../../refcallablelibrary/macros/homepagemodelinfo.html">Modeling information in the CPLEX Callable Library (C API)</a> 
in the reference manual of the Callable Library (C API), regardless of the API you are using.</p>
 </div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Warnings from modeling assistance</h2> 

<p class="p">When CPLEX solves a model with the <a class="xref" href="../../../../Parameters/topics/DataCheck.html" title="Turns on or off data consistency checking and modeling assistance.">data consistency checking and modeling assistance</a> parameter 
set to the value 2, CPLEX examines features of the model that can impede performance or 
produce numerical instability (even if the features are otherwise valid). 
When CPLEX detects such detrimental or unstable features as it solves your model, 
it issues a warning and suggests possible improvements. 
For example, the following warnings are typical of such 
situations:</p>
 
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>CPLEX Warning 1040: Detected a big coefficient for a binary
variable in a constraint. In constraint c171832, variable
x490416 has a coefficient 1000.21 times larger than second
largest. Consider turning constraint into an indicator.

CPLEX Warning 1041: Detected big-M constraint that could be
turned into an indicator. In constraint c8095, variable x354
has a bigM of 1000 and could be turned into indicator.

CPLEX Warning 1042: Detected a variable bound constraint with
large coefficients. Constraint c8101, links binary variable
x934 with variable x2642 and the ratio between the two is
1e+06. Consider turning constraint into an indicator for
better performance and numerical stability.</code></pre>
 </div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Special considerations about indices and names</h2> 
 
<p class="p">Some models include explicit names of variables and constraints. Other models do not. A model 
read from a file in SAV format, for example, can lack such names.</p>

<p class="p">If your model lacks names of variables or names of constraints, the warnings  
from modeling assistance refer to those variables or constraints by <strong class="ph b">index</strong>. In CPLEX modeling 
assistance, by convention, indices begin with 0 (zero). </p>
 
<p class="p">Recall that whether indices begin numbering at 0 (zero) or at 1 (one) 
can vary according to conventions of a programming language or other interface. For example, 
the Interactive Optimizer numbers indices from 1 (one), whereas the Callable Library (C API),  
following C programming conventions, numbers indices from 0 (zero). </p>
 
<p class="p">Consequently, when you receive warnings referring to constraints or variables by index, you 
need to convert the indices if there is such an incongruence between CPLEX modeling assistance 
(where indexing starts at 0 (zero)) and your interface (if indexing starts at 1 (one)). </p>
 
<p class="p">For example, suppose you are using the Interactive Optimizer (where indexing starts at 1 (one)) 
to read a SAV file with no names of constraints or variables. Suppose also that you have turned on 
modeling assistance. If CPLEX modeling assistance issues a warning about a constraint or variable 
in your model, the warning will refer to that constraint or variable by index. Keep in mind that 
in modeling assistance, numbering of indices starts at 0 (zero).  Consequently, in this example, 
you need to add one to the index reported in the modeling assistance warning in order to identify 
the constraint or variable in terms of the Interactive Optimizer.</p>
